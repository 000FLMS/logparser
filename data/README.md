## Testing Log Data

This directory maintains a set of publicly available log datasets used to benchmark our log parsers. 


###1: HPC-LA
The dataset contains the high performance cluster event logs collected at the Los 
Alamos National Laboratories. The event logs used to generate log templates were 
sourced from the "description of event" field of the event information of System 20.

The dataset is available at: http://institutes.lanl.gov/data/fdata
